I'm a full-stack software engineer currently studying at Atlas School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, blending a passion for technology with over ten years of experience in customer service and over three years in management and remote work.

My journey has been anything but linear—I've explored nursing, political science, communications, and more, always searching for something that truly captured my attention and allowed me to make a tangible impact.

With a lifelong love for video games, I realized that technology was the perfect avenue for me—a field where I could constantly solve real-world problems while staying engaged and inspired. So, I took the plunge into software engineering, and it's been a thrilling adventure ever since. I’ve picked up skills in team-building, problem-solving, and adaptability, along with technical proficiencies like managing git branches and programming in languages such as C, Python, HTML, CSS, and, most recently, JavaScript. (I think it's my favorite... but don't tell the others!)

Currently, I’m working on "Hobby Hop," a social media platform that connects people with their passions and communities, using the FERN stack (Firebase, Express, React, Node.js). This project is a great representation of the type of things I want to make as a software developer— building meaningful tools that bring people together and make a positive impact in their lives. My partner and I applied for Builders and Backers and we couldn’t be more excited about the future of this app! 

All that to say, I'm excited to merge my unique blend of empathy, adaptability, and creative problem-solving with my technical skills. I'm eager to collaborate with other people on a journey similar to mine, or completely different, and dive deeper into the intersection of technology and our lives.

The future is ours to shape. Let’s do it together!
